# OnlineCourse App

## Summary

This repository contains the code for the OnlineCourse app, developed as part of a lab that focuses on incorporating features into an app using class-based and generic views. The lab compares function-based views with built-in generic views, showcasing how class-based views streamline the development process by abstracting common tasks into super classes. This abstraction reduces workload and simplifies the implementation of app features.
