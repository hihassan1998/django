# OnlineCourse App

## Summary

This repository contains the code for the OnlineCourse app, developed as part of a lab that focuses on incorporating features into an app using class-based and generic views. The lab compares function-based views with built-in generic views, showcasing how class-based views streamline the development process by abstracting common tasks into super classes. This abstraction reduces workload and simplifies the implementation of app features. In this Django application is responsible for managing the process of verifying the identity of users. It includes features related to user registration, login, and logout.

##Key Terms
Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that individuals or systems attempting to access the application are who they claim to be.

##User
A User represents an individual interacting with the Django application. User information typically includes attributes such as a unique username, password, and email address.

##Registration
Registration is the process through which users create new accounts in the application. During registration, users provide necessary information, and their accounts are created for future access.

##Login
Login is the process where users provide credentials (such as a username and password) to gain access to protected areas of the application. Successful login establishes the user's identity and grants appropriate permissions.

##Logout
Logout is the process of ending a user's session and removing their authentication status. It is performed when a user wishes to log out or when a session expires, ensuring secure access management.
